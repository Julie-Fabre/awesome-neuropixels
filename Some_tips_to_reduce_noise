To reduce the amount of noise in you recording: 
- ensure your animal is properly grounded. You should have a wire going from the probe's ground to either a saline bath where you are recording or inside the skull/brain. Check that:
  - the soldered connection is good. You should see solder from the opposite side of where you soldered, and it should have a consistent cone shape. See more details [here](https://clarvis.co.uk/Electronics/Good-and-Bad-Soldering.html). 
  - your saline bath (if you are using one) is sufficiently full and the grounding wire is in the bath
- if using 2.0 probes, you additionally use an internal reference which will improve the signal quality
- check all elements on your rig are well grounded. Ideally, you want to ground all objects from one same central point, forming a star shape.
