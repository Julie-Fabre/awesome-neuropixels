When using 4-shank probes, or if you use dual probes (two probe cemented to each other front-to-front), shanks can become clumped together. 
This usually happens when there is some organic matter on the shanks. 
Some things that can help are: 
- leaving the probes shanks in a solution of 1% tergazyme (several hours or overnight should be enough), followed by rinsing the probes in DH20. 
- leaving the shanks in dH20 (several hours or overnight or overnight should be enough)
- using a small drop of water at the tip of a pipette to physically separate
the shank (using surface tension) under a microscope
- alternating between IPA and dH20 baths

As a *last* resort, you can attempt:
- to seperate the shanks manually (using a thin needle, parafilm, hair of a hairbrush, glass pipette with a long flexible tip for instance)
- to sonicate the shanks (using a sonicator). this is not recommended by IMEC, as it can cause damage to the probe

Both of these are more likely to result in breakage.
