When using 4-shank probes, or if you use dual probes (two probe cemented to each other front-to-front), shanks can become clumped together. 
This usually happens when there is some organic matter on the shanks. 
Some things that can help are: 
- leaving the probes shanks in a solution of 1% tergazyme, followed by rinsing the probes in DH20. 
- leaving the shanks in dH20
- using a small drop of water at the tip of a pipette to physically separate
the shank (using surface tension) under a microscope
- alternating between IPA and dH20 baths
- As a last resort, you can attempt to seperate the shanks manually or sonicate the shanks, but both of these are more likely to result in breakage
